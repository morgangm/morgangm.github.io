## Pivoting from FieldImageR

My capstone project originally started with me utilizing fieldimageR in order to process orthomosaics. But, fieldimageR utilizes rgdal as a package dependency, which was retired October of 2023. The retirement hadn't affected R until late September. After days of research and discussing the problem with fellow coworkers, I decided that the best steps going forward would be to utilizing another program for collecting vegetative indices since there is no current documentation of fieldImageR being updated to no longer be dependent on rgdal.

## QGIS and Python

Going forward, my project is going to utilize primarily python for indice extraction. I have been able to calculate NDVI through QGIS resulting in some very pretty heatmaps, but python is more streamlined than QGIS. My new goals consist of processing all flight dates through python. After this is completed, I can then begin analyzing the data!
