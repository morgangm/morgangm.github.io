After taking an 8 week intro to floral design course, I fell in love with floral artistry and thoroughly enjoyed piecing together my passions for plants and art! I decided to continue with floral design and pursue a certificate in Floral Artistry and Management. Everyday floral design was the second course that I took and focused on common design work, such as bouquets, wreaths, and seasonal designs! This course was also the first time I began working on my concept florist shop: Honey and Hyacinth!
