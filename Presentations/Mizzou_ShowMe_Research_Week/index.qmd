I was able to present a poster alongside Madison Mitchell, one of my coworkers for the 2024 spring Show Me Research Week at Mizzou! Madison and I continued to present over her project focusing on using drone imaging to monitor plant responses to flooding. Presenting this poster was a great experience that helped me sharpen my communication skills and prepare for future presentations!
