As part of my senior capstone experience, students are required to summarize their experience (research or internship) in a presentation given to other senior level Plant Science majors, as well as other students, faculty, and staff, who can attend. During April of 2025, I presented my own research project, titled "Utilizing Drone Imaging to Monitor Crop Health in Maize," where I discussed my project in the Washburn lab focusing on the relationship between NDVI, plant health, and yield in maize. I was able to showcase the project from start to finish, including the data collection, analysis, and interpretation stages, and concluded with my current findings at the time and shed light on future possibilities for the project.
