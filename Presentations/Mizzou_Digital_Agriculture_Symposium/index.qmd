The Digital Agriculture Symposium was an event held by Mizzou over the summer of 2024 that consisted of two days: a formal symposium complete with talks from other professionals and presentations, and a second field day that consisted of visiting the digital agriculture farm. I was able to present a poster with one of my colleagues, Madison Mitchell. This poster expanded on the project that I had been previously working on with her, and focused on flood responses in maize. We were incredibly lucky to receive 3rd place in the poster competition! The picture above is us with our poster displayed at the field day!
