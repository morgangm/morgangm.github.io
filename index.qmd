Hello! I am Morgan Mathison. I am a Postbaccalaureate researcher at the University of Kansas, where I am currently researching Plant Evolution. ðŸŒ±

Prior to my current position, I earned my BS in Plant Science at the University of Missouri in May of 2025, where I also completed a minor in Biology and a certificate in Retail Floral Management. As an undergrad, I was involved in research and assisted in a USDA lab, where I worked on utilizing drone imaging in plant phenotyping.

This website serves as a collection of my past and current projects, as well as presentations and achievements!
