Hello! I am Morgan Mathison. I am a Postbaccalaureate researcher at the [University of Kansas](https://biodiversity.ku.edu/people/morgan-mathison-paleobotany){style="color: pink"}, where I am currently working in the Natural History Museum's department of Paleobotany. I am researching angiosperm evolution and diversification in the Upper Cretaceous! ðŸŒ±ðŸ”¬

Prior to my current position, I earned my BS in Plant Science at the University of Missouri in May of 2025, where I also completed a minor in Biology and a certificate in Retail Floral Management. As an undergrad, I was involved in research and assisted in a USDA lab, where I worked on utilizing drone imaging in plant phenotyping.

This website serves as a collection of my past and current projects, as well as presentations and achievements!
