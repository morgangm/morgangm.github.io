For this project, I focused on looking into lodging data from each of the plots to identify which plots experienced the most and least amount of lodging during the season. We found that lodging data was less correlated with specific genotypes, and theorized that the topography of the field was a major factor on plants that experienced lodging versus those that didn’t. This was my first presentation experience, and I highly appreciate Madison for letting me assist in her project!"

    "text": "What is NDVI?\nAfter running the QGIS grids and orthomosaics through the python script, I ended up with a large collection of vegetative indices extracted for each individual plot of maize for every flight. These .csv files included a wide variety of indices, including GNDVI, SAVI, EVI, and MCARI. My project is focusing on NDVI; Normalized Difference Vegetative Index, a plant health indicator that examines photosynthetic capacity of a plant. The equation utilizes reflectance values of red light (R) and near infrared light (NIR) to record how much red light and near infrared light the plant is absorbing versus reflecting. The graphic I created below is based off of another figure I made for an upcoming publication with Madison Mitchell. Photosynthetically active plants would be utilizing a large amount of red light and not reflecting it, as red light is a major wavelength utilized for photosynthesis. But near infrared light is just at the edge of the absorption spectrum, leading to plants only absorbing some of it. In an unhealthy plant, not as much red light is being absorbed and used in photosynthesis, leading to a large amount of reflection, indicating a decrease in photosynthetic capacity.\n\n\nProject Goal\nMy capstone project looks at NDVI values across the growing season of 2023 in two separate fields containing the same genotypes of maize in Columbia, Missouri. The goal is to compare the values between both fields alongside environmental data to better understand the relationship between NDVI and genotype by environment interactions (GxE).\n\n\nCurrent Progress\nAs of current, I have been able to calculate NDVI values for each plot of plants during each flight date. I brought these .csv values into R, and with assistance from Daniel Kick, created a script to assign rows and ranges to the values and make heatmaps for each flight! Below are some of the heatmaps from the Rollins 6 Field.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis project has been a challenge, and the consistent support from my PI and fellow lab members have been an amazing help! A special thank you to Worasit Sangjan for Python extraction scripts, Harper Lafond for Pix4D assistance, Daniel Kick for R debugging, and my PI Dr. Washburn for continuous assistance and advising in this project!

    "text": "My capstone project originally started with me utilizing fieldimageR in order to process orthomosaics. But, fieldimageR utilizes rgdal as a package dependency, which was retired October of 2023. The retirement hadn’t affected R until late September. After days of research and discussing the problem with fellow coworkers, I decided that the best steps going forward would be to utilizing another program for collecting vegetative indices since there is no current documentation of fieldImageR being updated to no longer be dependent on rgdal."

    "text": "QGIS and Python\nGoing forward, my project is going to utilize primarily python for indice extraction. I have been able to calculate NDVI through QGIS resulting in some very pretty heatmaps, but python is more streamlined than QGIS. My new goals consist of processing all flight dates through python. After this is completed, I can then begin analyzing the data!"

    "text": "What is NDVI?\nAfter running the QGIS grids and orthomosaics through the python script, I ended up with a large collection of vegetative indices extracted for each individual plot of maize for every flight. These .csv files included a wide variety of indices, including GNDVI, SAVI, EVI, and MCARI. My project is focusing on NDVI; Normalized Difference Vegetative Index, a plant health indicator that examines photosynthetic capacity of a plant. The equation utilizes reflectance values of red light (R) and near infrared light (NIR) to record how much red light and near infrared light the plant is absorbing versus reflecting. The graphic I created below is based off of another figure I made for an upcoming publication with Madison Mitchell. Photosynthetically active plants would be utilizing a large amount of red light and not reflecting it, as red light is a major wavelength utilized for photosynthesis. But near infrared light is just at the edge of the absorption spectrum, leading to plants only absorbing some of it. In an unhealthy plant, not as much red light is being absorbed and used in photosynthesis, leading to a large amount of reflection, indicating a decrease in photosynthetic capacity.\n\n\nProject Goal\nMy capstone project looks at NDVI values across the growing season of 2023 in two separate fields containing the same genotypes of maize in Columbia, Missouri. The goal is to compare the values between both fields alongside environmental data to better understand the relationship between NDVI and genotype by environment interactions (GxE).\n\n\nCurrent Progress\nAs of current, I have been able to calculate NDVI values for each plot of plants during each flight date. I brought these .csv values into R, and with assistance from Daniel Kick, created a script to assign rows and ranges to the values and make heatmaps for each flight! Below are some of the heatmaps from the Rollins 6 Field.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis project has been a challenge, and the consistent support from my PI and fellow lab members have been an amazing help! A special thank you to Worasit Sangjan for Python extraction scripts, Harper Lafond for Pix4D assistance, Daniel Kick for R debugging, and my PI Dr. Washburn for continuous assistance and advising in this project! I cant wait to see this project continue! :)"

I calculated this in the form of Pearson R tests for each flight date, to determine the best time in the season to calculate yield based off of NDVI. (When in the season the correlation was highest)"

I presented an updated poster of my capstone project, including work I had done since my last poster the previous semester. Besides presenting a poster, and connecting with and recieving insightful feedback from other researchers focused on maize, I was also able to attend a variety of panels and presentations, where I was able to learn further about the wide array of research questions and studies being conducted with maize as the organism of interest. I am incredibly thankful for the organizing committee for planning and hosting this conference, and appreciated the opportunity to continue to present my research and connect with individuals conducting similar studies."

During April of 2025, I presented my own research project, titled “Utilizing Drone Imaging to Monitor Crop Health in Maize,” where I discussed my project in the Washburn lab focusing on the relationship between NDVI, plant health, and yield in maize. I was able to showcase the project from start to finish, including the data collection, analysis, and interpretation stages, and concluded with my current findings at the time and shed light on future possibilities for the project."
